# CSVTODATABASE

The Java program reads data from a CSV file and inserts or updates records in a MySQL database. It uses batch processing for better performance and checks for the existence of records in the database based on the primary key. This program can be useful for importing or synchronizing data from a CSV file to a MySQL database. It is important to ensure that the CSV file structure and database schema match for successful data transfer.
